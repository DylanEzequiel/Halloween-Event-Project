        All (or most) of us know what is Halloween, and even many of us may
        celebrate this popular holiday. However, not all of us know the history
        of this fascinating tradition that many countries celebrate, so I invite
        you to stay on this website where you will learn all about the origin and
        history of Halloween.
      </p>

        <h2>Concept</h2>
        <p>
          Halloween or Hallowe'en is the name of a popular holiday also known as
          Night of the Dead, All Saints' Eve or Halloween. Normally, this
          celebration involves sinister or horror costumes and decorations,
          linked to the world of the dead and witches, and is celebrated every
          year on October 31.
        </p>

        <p>
          The name of this celebration is the contraction of All Hallows'
          Evening, since it is celebrated on the night before "All Saints' Day",
          according to the calendar of the Western Christian Church. It is a
          festival of the Anglo-Saxon nations. It has also spread, by cultural
          contagion, in countries such as Spain and in several Latin American
          nations.
        </p>

        <p>
          The current variants of Halloween tend to respond to the more
          commercial and secular modes of celebration, especially in the United
          States of America, with costumes, parties and trick or treating (in
          other words, "sweet or joke": asking the neighbors for some candy to
          eat under threatens to play tricks on them if they don't agree).
          However, in many countries traditional practices such as bringing
          candles to the graves of the deceased or refraining from consuming
          meat on that evening are still carried out.
        </p>

        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p>
          The origin of Halloween is actually uncertain, but everything
          indicates that it is an inheritance from the ancient Celtic cultures
          of the British Isles, who celebrated Samhain on that date, which means
          the end of summer, according to their calendar. On that date, the
          ancient Celts bid farewell to Laugh, the sun god, and believed that in
          his absence the dead might briefly return to Earth. So, to drive them
          away, they lit big fires and wore ritual masks and costumes, so that
          they would not be recognized by the evil spirits.
        </p>

        <p>
          The romanization of these European regions caused the Celtic tradition
          of Samhain to be mixed with many Latin rites such as the Feralia and
          the Pomona: the first in honor of the Manes, chthonic deities
          equivalent to the souls of the recently deceased; the second in honor
          of the goddess Pomona, who was asked for the abundance of crops.
        </p>

        <p>
          The subsequent Christianization of the continent frowned on these
          types of festivals, and it is possible that they wanted to replace
          them with the celebration of All Saints' Day every November 1. But in
          the Middle Ages, pagan and monotheistic traditions intermingled
          regularly, and the Protestant Reformation weakened papal authority in
          northern European kingdoms, allowing Halloween to continue to be
          celebrated.

        <h2>Symbols</h2>
        <p>
          Currently, the holiday of Halloween is associated with different
          symbols, many of which come from medieval tradition, while others come
          from modern times. As for the main symbols of Halloween are:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Pumpkins .-</b>
              These fruits are associated with Halloween due to the Anglo-Saxon
              custom of emptying them of their contents, sculpting a face on
              their surfaces and then placing a candle inside, to use them as a
              sinister decorative object. This symbol recalls a character from
              Irish tradition known as Jack O'lantern, who according to the
              story was a cunning miser who managed to escape from the devil,
              keeping two embers from hell inside a vegetable, to use as a
              lantern.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Bat, spiders and cobwebs .-</b>
              Spider webs are part of the Halloween decoration, as a symbol of
              old and abandoned, since these animals usually make their nests in
              rarely frequented places, such as cemeteries or abandoned houses.
              The same happens with bats, animals that usually live in caves,
              buildings under construction or other desolate places.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Witches and black cats .-</b>
              Halloween night is also known as Witches' Night, probably because
              it was considered since ancient times as a propitious time for
              divination and futurology, since it was the end of the year in the
              Celtic calendar. And the witches, a contribution from medieval
              Christianity to the imagery of Halloween, were precisely sinister
              women who made deals with demons and obtained from them the power
              for sorcery and divination. Black cats were associated with
              witches, either because they could take their form or because they
              were confidants in the dark arts.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Scarecrows .-</b>
              Since Halloween was originally a celebration linked to the end of
              summer and harvest time, the scarecrow remains one of its
              traditional icons today, often combined with a horse (especially
              if the scarecrow has one for a head). These figures, so common in
              farm fields, take on a sinister connotation on All Hallows' Eve.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Skulls and ghosts .-</b>
              As in other celebrations of the All Soul's day, on Halloween
              skulls, skeletons and ghosts are present in their most
              conventional representation, as emblems of the spirits that are
              loose throughout this night.

        <h2>Traditions</h2>
        <p>
          Halloween traditions can vary from place to place, especially as the
          tradition reinvents itself in modern times, gaining and losing
          elements. However, some of its most popular and well-known traditions
          are:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Gastronomy .-</b>
              The typical Halloween cuisine usually gives sweets a prominent
              role, through the preparation of sweet or caramel apples, and
              fruit cakes. Corn is also a common element, especially in the
              agricultural regions of the United States of America, as well as
              the omnipresent pumpkin, although the latter is not necessarily
              part of the diet, but to make the typical decorations.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Customes .-</b>
              The tradition of dressing up on Halloween has a long history,
              although in recent times it has become something that most niches
              do, wearing costumes of their fashionable fictional characters,
              such as superheroes, movie characters or related.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Trick or treating .-</b>
              It is usual that, throughout the night of Halloween, costumed
              children visit their nearby neighbors to ask for sweets and
              trinkets, through trick or treating. Children are supposed to
              embody mischievous spirits who, if they do not receive an
              offering, bewitch and harass the family.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <b>House decoration .-</b>
              It is also common for houses to be decorated for the occasion on
              Halloween, using not only pumpkins, but also other implements that
              make them look like sinister or haunted places. It is not unusual
              for neighbors to dress up as well and try to scare visiting
              children. Orange, purple and black colors abound in these
              decorations.

        <h2>Popularity</h2>
        <p>
          The popularity of Halloween in the world is due to the influence and
          massification of American culture, especially through Hollywood and
          other international cultural industries. The presence of Halloween in
          American films and series is very common. This has caused the festival
          to spread to countries outside the Anglo-Saxon culture, such as the
          Latin American nations.
